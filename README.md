P-3C Orion for Flightgear

Remove -master from the end of the name to install

Modified from initial L-188 Model by niltondc, Martien Van der Plas, and David Waggoner to P-3C by Zorka
Probably messed a ton of stuff up. Fixes are appreciated, and I completely understand if you would prefer to make a new one from scratch rather than deal with this abomination.
